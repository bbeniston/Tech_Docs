This article shows how to install Cypress and remove Protractor in Angular.

Cypress is a frontend testing tool built for end to end tests. The test scripts can be executed and it runs the tests like a real QA professional. The code looks more or less like a Javascript. We can execute the Cypress tests as a separate project. It can be executed along with the CICD. It can be configured with the modern Frontend frameworks.

Auto reload.
